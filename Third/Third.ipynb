    "# Load Word, Store Word\n",
    "\n",
    "## What do they do each?\n",
    "`lw`: Load word instruction, loads a word (32 bits stored in the memory (4 bytes of data)) into a register,\n",
    "\n",
    "`sw`: Store word on the other hand, stores a word into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Which type of instructions they are?\n",
    "They are `I format` instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How can we use 'em in assembly code?\n",
    "The systax of using `lw` and `sw` in assembly code is like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```assembly\n",
    "(l/s)w $t1, 1200($s1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`lw`: In load word instuction the first register (`$t1` in this case) is the destination of what is in the address: `1200 + address stored in $s1`. That 1200 means: 4 * 300 = 1200, go 300 steps **after** (because the number is postitive, clearly **before** if it was negative) the address in register `$s1` (because each word is 4 bytes long)\n",
    "\n",
    "`sw`: In store word instruction the first register has the data to be stored. The addressing issue is dealy in the same way in both instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Which signals of control unit are _don't care_ for 'em?\n",
    "`lw`: There is no _don't care_ signal for `lw` instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "`sw`: `RegDst` and `MemToReg` singals are _don't care_ for `sw` instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Describe the data path and control unit state, meanwhile of the execution of one of these.\n",
    "\n",
    "When `lw` or `sw` instructions are fetched from memory, they are meant to be decoded. Let's see a prototype of a fetched `lw` instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "```assembly\n",
    "\n",
    "lw $t1, 0($s1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "it will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "let's assume: $t1 -> 00000, $s1 -> 00001\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------\n",
    "| 6-bit-opcode | 00001 | 00000 | 0000000000000000 |\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So the needed signals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decode phase: In this phase the needed operands are fetched and the instruction will be ready to be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `RegDest -> 0` to select `Rt` for the destination\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `ExtOp -> 1` to sign extend the 16-bit immediate value\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - `RegWrite -> 1` 'cause it needs the permission to write to register file\n",
    "\n",
    "- Execution Phase: In this phase, ALU will add the extended value and the address in `Rs` and produce a memory address and will get the value in there\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `ALUSrc -> 1` to select the extended value to be one of the inputs of ALU\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - `MemWrite -> 0` it should not write anything to memory\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - `MemToReg -> 1` 'cause it has to choose the output of memory not ALU\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write back: The got value will be written in register file\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `MemRead -> 1` it should have the permission to read from memory\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - `Branch -> 0` we do not branch in `lw`"
